# THE IMMORTAL CELL
A project to create a program that programs another program.

### WHY?
> Science isn't about *why* - it's about *why not*. *Why* is so much of our science dangerous? Why not *marry* safe science if you love it so much? In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you in the butt on the way out, because *you are fired!* Not you, test subject. You're doing fine. Yes, *you*. Box. Your stuff. Out the front door. Parking lot. Car. Goodbye.
